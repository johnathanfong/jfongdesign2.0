# Welcome to JFONGDESIGN 2.0

Two years ago JFONGDESIGN (v1.0) launched. 
I had just graduated from HackerYou's 9-week intensive Front-End Web Development Bootcamp â€“ easily the most challenging 9 weeks of my adult life (to date).

The good news: I got a job within 10 days of graduation at a Digital Agency here in Toronto, ON, Canada.

The bad news: JFONGDESIGN never saw an update. Until now! (Even if v2.0 is very much a WIP).

## Why WordPress?

When I first started working, freelancing was unthinkable. Coming off the bootcamp high, my confidence was at an all-time low. I had, what I called, "Impostor Syndrome". A Graphic Designer by trade, was I really doing this? Was I really committing to a career as a Front-End Web Developer?

Two years later, I've overcome many (read: a million and one) challenges; embraced a few failures; celebrated my successes; and finally feel I'm ready to explore freelancing. I mean, wasn't that the point of learning a _complimentary_ skillset? Why not _build_ what I can _design_?

Given that 29% of the web runs on WordPress, it only made sense to re-visit this powerful tool and re-learn theme development. What better example than my personal portfolio?

## Lesson's Learned

- At the agency, I have a lovely Lead Architect that sets up every project infrastructure. Setting up JFONGDESIGN 2.0 has been a very humbling experience.
- Thankfully, there are many (free) resources and training materials on the internet.
- I rely way too much on SourceTree to do simple commands than should be executed on Terminal. It has made me rusty.
- Developers who do this full-time... kudos to you.
